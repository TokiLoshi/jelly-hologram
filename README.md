- [x] get test mesh to render and animated
- [x] commit project
- [x] deploy to vercel
- [x] import model
- [x] apply hologram effect
- [x] apply coffee smoke effect to procedurally generate tentacles
- [ ] add the glitch if the jelly is touched or make it zap
- [ ] 2*noise(3*x+t)+f3(x,t) - start with a line
- [ ] add helper widgets (leva, perf)

- [ ] use the differnt channels to get multiple noises
- [ ] experiment using colour in the image
- [ ] add tone mapping that's included in the fragment shader
- [ ] apply scaling to look like jellyfish are growing and moving
